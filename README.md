# cursor: not-allowed

Every week, [@zineanteoh](https://github.com/zineanteoh) and I give ourselves an hour to create a goofy project solely with AI. No human coding, any idea you can think of.

This is my project for week 3. I hate cursors. Or more specifically, I hate it when people use cursors to navigate when they can use the much superior keyboard shortcuts instead. 

So I decided to build a mini sandbox to do exactly that. No cursors allowed here. 

Total time taken: 1 hour. I timed myself this time. 

Techstack/technologies used:

TailwindCSS (barely)
Cursor Pro
Typescript
Vite 

# Previews:

Before you ask, I spent 20 minutes fighting Tailwind, so I built all of this without being able to see any of the styling. Which is why it looks the way it looks.
